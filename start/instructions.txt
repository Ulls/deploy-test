You will need Java, maven, Docker and Ansible installed to complete this exercise.  If you don't have those dependencies, please install them before proceeding.

There exists a public repository at https://github.com/ulls/deploy-test
Inside this repo is a simple Java Spring Boot web application
The working directory for the application is Ulls/deploy-test/start
The application is built using maven: ./mvnw package
The application is run with the java command: java -jar target/gs-spring-boot-docker-0.1.0.jar
When running, the application will respond on http://localhost:8080

Please complete the following task:
Create a Dockerfile and containerize the application
Create an Ansible playbook that will...
1) download the source to ~/Deploy/deploy-test
2) Create a docker registory running locally on port 5000
3) build and containerize the application
4) push the docker image to the localhost:5000 registry
5) pull the image and run the application
