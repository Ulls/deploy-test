You will need Java, maven, Docker and Ansible installed to complete this exercise.  If you don't have those dependencies, please install them before proceeding.

There exists a public repository at https://github.com/ulls/deploy-test
Inside this repo is a simple Java Spring Boot web application
The working directory for the application is Ulls/deploy-test/start
The application is built using maven: ./mvnw package
The application is run with the java command: java -jar target/gs-spring-boot-docker-0.1.0.jar
When running, the application will respond on http://localhost:8080

Please complete the following tasks:

1) Create a Dockerfile and containerize the application
1a) Run the application locally in its container
1b) Create a docker registory running locally on port 5000
1c) Push the container to the local registry

2) Create an Ansible playbook to "deploy" the application.  The application will be deployed locally, to another directory.  The Ansible playbook should
2a) download the source to ~/Deploy/deploy-test
2b) build and containerize the application
2c) push the docker image to the localhost:5000 registry
2d) pull the image and run the application

Run the playbook.  If the outcome is the application running locally, in a docker container from the ~/Deploy/deploy-test directory you have completed the exercise.
